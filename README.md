Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Wolf Man and like, where do I even start? LOL. It was such a ride, like I’m vibing with the whole aesthetic, you know? But damn, kinda tired now. It's one of those old flicks, but still kinda hits different. You get me? Seriously though, the transformation scenes were wild, but I gotta say, they look a bit cheesy now. Like, IMAGINE seeing that as a kid – would’ve been terrifying. 😂

Anyway, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   just to get the full vibe, not to mention the fact that it's kinda hard to 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 this stuff sometimes. You know that feeling when you finally get to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something you wanted to for ages? Yeah, it’s like that – nostalgia hitting kinda hard. There’s this bit where the dude starts realizing he's screwed and I'm just like, bro, we've all been there, haven’t we? Relatable, sorta. 🤷‍♂️

> So I’m thinking, like, why are werewolves always so tortured? They need a break, man. Just let ‘em have a chill picnic or something once in a while. They’re always running around going crazy. I mean, I get it, curse of the wolf and all, but still. Can't catch a break. Oh, and the love story subplot… sweet but like, also really “did that need to happen?” Haha, poor guy just wanted to, I dunno, chill under the moon.

Can't lie, it's a bit over the top sometimes, like, old  s are so dramatic and intense, right? But lowkey, I eat that stuff up. There’s something about that black-and-white setup that’s got this weird but cool vibe. I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 more of these oldies. Reminds me how  s used to be about scaring you with shadows and fog and stuff. Not a CGI jump-scare fest, you know what I’m sayin'?

def wolf_howl(moon): return 'Awooo!' if moon == 'full' else 'ZZZ'

Anyways, wanna grab a coffee sometime soon or something? Could use a catch-up session. Just hit me up. Peace!
